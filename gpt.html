				<h2>GPT-3</h2>
				<img src="gpt-image1.png" alt="GPT logo" class="example-image img-fluid rounded">
				<p>GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) is a natural language processing AI model developed by OpenAI. It is one of the largest and most powerful language models in the world, with 175 billion parameters. GPT-3 can perform a wide range of tasks, such as language translation, writing essays, answering questions, and generating creative content.</p>

				<h2>Limitations</h2>
				<p>Despite its many strengths, GPT-3 also has some limitations:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>It can generate biased or inaccurate content, as it is trained on human-generated data which can contain biases and errors.</li>
					<li>It may generate inappropriate or offensive content, as it has no understanding of social norms and cultural sensitivity.</li>
					<li>It may struggle with complex reasoning and logical deduction, as it is primarily designed for language processing tasks.</li>
					<li>It requires significant computing resources and energy to train and run, making it less accessible for smaller organizations or individuals.</li>
